        <p> This pretty girl has been designed and brought to life by me on Photoshop. I first used a brush to give the outline, then I used the paint-bucket
		tool to color her. Finally, I gave the touch-ups with highlights and shadows. Look how she's looking at you with her bright brown eyes. Give her a smile! </p>
